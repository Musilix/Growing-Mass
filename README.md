# Growing-Mass
A JS program using p5.js to randomly span across the screen in multiple directions, making random, yet interesting designs and patterns. No purpose really, it just looks cool. I plan to utilize this alongside a GA in order to exhibit pathfinding capabiltiies, similar to that of the physarum polycephalum slime mold.
